# 2023_mask_study

The scripts in this repo correspond to the Merenstein et al. 2023 paper investigating the impact of mask reuse on the microbiome.

Raw data can be downloaded from NCBI at the following link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA926513/

Data were processed in QIIME using the script run_qiime.sh in the qiime folder. Any re-analysis of this data will require modification of the script to match the location and IDs of the sequencing files after downloading from NCBI. Metadata available on the NCBI bioproject page will map from our sample IDs to the SRA numbers.

All processed data is available in the data directory. These data are sufficient to replicate all figures in the manuscript, using the scripts in the scripts folder.
